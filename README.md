## What is a Software Template?

A Software Template is a set of files that can be used to create a new Software Component. It can be used to create a new Software Component from scratch or to update an existing one. You can find more information about Software Templates in the [Backstage Documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/concepts).
